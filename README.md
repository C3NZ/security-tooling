# Security tools

## Description
This project is a list of all my security research tools that I build out
through tutorials or projects.

## Overall goals
- [ ] Learn more about security.
- [ ] Create a neat tool set and potentially use bazel to run it!
- [ ] Code code code!

## How to run/setup
This project will most likely use bazel to build.

## How to deploy
This will most likely not have anything to deploy, but you never know!

## How to contribute
Fork the current repository and then make the changes that you'd like to said fork. Upon adding features, fixing bugs,
or whatever modifications you've made to the project, issue a pull request to this repository containing the changes that you've made
and I will evaluate them before taking further action. This process may take anywhere from 3-7 days depending on the scope of the changes made, 
my schedule, and any other variable factors.
